# initializing this config file, you can point the function to a data sample that
# will auto fill the columns.
# Some columns will just exist in the final table, you will build them at 
# `publish.sql` query. For those, set is_in_staging to False.
# Also, you have to add the partition columns here and set is_partition to True.
