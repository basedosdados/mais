This API is composed of functions with two types of functionality:

- Modules for **data request**: for those who only want to consult the data and metadata of our project.

- Classes for **data management** in Google Cloud: for those who want to upload data to our project (or any other project in Google Cloud, following our methodology and infrastructure).
